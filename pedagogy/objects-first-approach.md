# Objects-First Approach

The Code.org CSA curriculum covers the content in a layered approach that allows students to develop an understanding of the content while simultaneously developing computational thinking skills. Students learn the fundamentals of object-oriented programming (OOP) first, giving them a foundation for the rest of the course while encouraging them to consider the overall design of their programs. This is a different sequence than the suggested outline provided in the AP CSA Course and Exam Description.

If you are new to object-oriented programming, please refer to the appendix for resources that can help familiarize yourself with object-oriented programming and the suggested College Board sequence. This can help contextualize the objects-first approach that Code.org takes in AP CSA.

### Organization of the Content in the Code.org AP CSA Curriculum

In the Code.org CSA curriculum, the content and conceptual understandings found within the units in the AP CSA CED are organized in an objects-first approach. The curriculum begins with the introduction of classes and objects and their roles within a program. Students learn about inheritance in the first unit, and each following unit expands their understanding of object-oriented programming design. Fundamental programming concepts are implemented as tools for expanding the capabilities of classes and improving the way objects interact with each other in a program.

The objects-first approach is interwoven with the Software Engineering for All narrative of the curriculum to provide students meaningful opportunities to develop interactive and engaging programs while practicing skills in the Computational Thinking Practices. Students visualize themselves as software engineers as they learn to expand the capabilities of their programs using conditionals, loops, and data structures, all within the context of designing and using classes and objects which interact with each other to solve real-world problems.

### Pedagogical Approaches to Teaching Object-Oriented Programming

There is a lot of debate about the most appropriate approach to teaching an object-oriented programming language. Two common approaches to teaching object-oriented programming languages are the imperative-first approach, which is also referred to as objects-late, and the objects-first approach.

#### Imperative-First (Objects-Late)

In the imperative-first approach, programming is often taught by starting with simple ideas and concepts, such as variables and methods to print to the console. The idea is to provide a gentle learning curve by building programming knowledge and skills incrementally. Instruction gradually advances to more complex ideas, including classes and objects. The imperative-first approach focuses on writing statements to manipulate the state of a program by providing commands for the computer to perform. This approach is also known as an objects-late first, as students learn to work with variables, methods, conditionals, and loops before exposure to object-oriented programming structures and design.

#### Objects-First

In the objects-first approach, students first develop an understanding of classes and objects and learn to work with variables, methods, conditionals, and loops within the context of objects. The goal of an objects-first approach is to help students "develop a mindset where object-oriented concepts have a natural place" rather than introducing object-oriented programming as a paradigm shift later in a curriculum. The objects-first approach teaches variables, methods, conditionals, and loops as tools that programmers use to define a class and work with objects.

#### Imperative-First vs Objects-First

There are pros and cons to both approaches. The Computing Curricula 2001 report noted the following concerns for implementing an imperative-first approach:

> Programming courses often focus on syntax and the particular characteristics of a programming language, leading students to concentrate on these relatively unimportant details rather than the underlying algorithmic skills. This focus on details means that many students fail to comprehend the essential algorithmic model that transcends particular programming languagesâ€¦concentrating on the mechanistic details of programming constructs often leaves students to figure out the essential character of programming through an ad hoc process of trial and error.

However, teaching objects-first can be challenging to beginning students if there is not an appropriate balance between teaching object-oriented principles and the basic programming constructs, such as conditionals and loops. For an objects-first approach to be successful, the environment and instructional materials need to support an objects-first development of programs. Consideration must be taken to reduce the cognitive load for students when learning the syntax and features of an object-oriented programming language that are known to be barriers to beginning students.

### Objects-First in the Code.org AP CSA Curriculum

We believe an objects-first approach is most effective for teaching Java and object-oriented programming. This approach provides opportunities for students to interact with and develop meaningful and engaging projects early in the curriculum while developing skills in the Computational Thinking Practices. Students develop an understanding and appreciation for software design and development while learning Java. They visualize themselves as software engineers while developing solutions similar to those they are familiar with or have encountered in the real world.

Implementing an objects-first approach to AP CSA helps students:

* Design solutions that more intuitively model their understanding of the world.
* Practice software engineering skills.
* Strengthen understanding of Java and object-oriented programming principles.

How students perceive the world is an important consideration of any successful pedagogical approach, including a culturally responsive pedagogy. We believe that teaching students to design solutions using classes and objects fits more intuitively into a student's understanding of the world. With object-oriented programming principles, students can make connections between the concepts they are learning and the mental models and funds of knowledge they already have. Programming fundamentals such as conditionals, loops, and data structures are easily tied back to the idea of designing and expanding the functionality of an object. The curriculum is designed to guide students through understanding how programs are used to represent information that exists in the real world to develop solutions for problems they have or might encounter.

We believe that an objects-first approach is best supported with visual and interactive tools to help make "the information apprehensible, apparent and visible to the learners." In the Code.org CSA curriculum, students are introduced to object-oriented programming concepts using The Neighborhood, which provides a model of a familiar real-world environment which students navigate and manipulate using a Painter object.

\
This visual metaphor engages students while providing opportunities to solve interesting problems early in the curriculum. The use of The Neighborhood and The Theater helps students make connections between their own mental models for solving problems and the way solutions are implemented in Java. These tools support students in thinking in terms of classes and object behaviors while using both graphical and textual representations of problems and their solutions.8 We believe that presenting problems with visual metaphors and models makes object-oriented programming and design principles easier for beginning students to learn and helps students see the effects of their code to identify errors when the outcome is not what they expected.

Strong programming skills require an understanding of the structure of a program within its paradigm. We believe students achieve greater success when learning Java as an object-oriented programming language early rather than attempting to shift the understanding of the language and program structure later. The imperatives-first approach is counterintuitive to the way programming is largely done by software engineers. Programs developed in Java use conditionals, loops, and data structures as tools to expand the capabilities of objects and the way these objects interact with each other to solve problems. The concepts and skills students learn in AP CSA should be practical and applicable beyond the classroom so that existing habits do not need to be unlearned to be successful in future opportunities.

As part of our Software Engineering for All narrative, students develop an appreciation for the design of a program and implement solutions to model real-world problems and scenarios. The tools that are incorporated into the curriculum allow the complexity of the Java programming language to be minimized so that new concepts can be presented to students simply and in manageable chunks throughout the year. We believe that introducing these skills early allows students to meaningfully practice the computational thinking practices often throughout the course. Rather than learning to write long methods that simply replicate procedural programming paradigms and solve problems in a procedural way, they learn best practices and habits for software engineering that do not need to be unlearned in future courses or career opportunities. Additionally, the AP CSA Course and Exam Description states that:

> Computer scientists use computers to study and model the world, and this requires designing program code to fit a given scenario. Spending time to plan out the program up front will shorten overall program development time. Practicing elements of the iterative development process early and often will help create more robust programs and avoid logical errors.
>
> Students should have many opportunities in this course to design their own classes based on program specifications and on observations of real-world objects.
>
> Once the new class is designed, students should be able to implement program code to create a new type by creating a class. The behaviors of an object are expressed through writing methods in the class, which include expressions, conditional statements, and iterative statements. By being able to create their own classes, programmers are not limited to the existing classes provided within the Java libraries and can therefore represent their own ideas through classes.

Implementing an objects-first approach provides opportunities from the beginning of the year to design and develop programs and classes and use conditionals, loops, and data structures to expand the capabilities of objects. Students practice the skills in the Computational Thinking Practices to design, write, test, and document program code that implements solutions to meaningful and interesting problems that connect with their understanding of the world. While learning Java, students use tools similar to those used by software engineers and learn best practices for software development to encourage them to visualize themselves as software engineers. This approach makes learning programming and software development more meaningful and engaging while also developing an understanding and appreciation of some of the challenges in developing software projects, regardless of whether they intend to pursue a career as a software engineer.
