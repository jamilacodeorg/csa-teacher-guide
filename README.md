# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Computer Science A

Code.orgâ€™s Computer Science A (CSA) curriculum is a full-year, rigorous curriculum that introduces students to software engineering and object-oriented programming and design using the Java programming language. This curriculum covers a broad range of topics, including the design of solutions to problems, the use of data structures to organize large sets of data, the development and implementation of algorithms to process data and discover new information, the analysis of potential solutions, and the ethical and social implications of computing systems. All teacher and student materials are provided for free online and can be accessed at [**code.org/csa**](http://code.org/csa).

### AP Endorsed

Code.org is recognized by the College Board as an endorsed provider of curriculum and professional development for APÂ® Computer Science A (AP CSA). This endorsement affirms that all components of Code.orgâ€™s CSA offerings are aligned to the AP Curriculum Framework standards, the AP CSA assessment, and the AP framework for professional development. Using an endorsed provider affords schools access to resources including an AP CSA syllabus pre-approved by the College Boardâ€™s AP Course Audit, and officially recognized professional development that prepares teachers to teach AP CSA.

### Prerequisites

The Code.org CSA curriculum is recommended for any high school student who wishes to continue their computer science education after completing an introductory course such as Computer Science Principles (CSP) or Computer Science Discoveries (CSD).

Additionally, the College Board makes the following recommendation:

> It is recommended that a student in the AP Computer Science A course has successfully completed a first-year high school algebra course with a strong foundation of basic linear functions, composition of functions, and problem-solving strategies that require multiple approaches and collaborative efforts. In addition, students should be able to use a Cartesian (x, y) coordinate system to represent points on a plane. It is important that students and their advisers understand that any significant computer science course builds upon a foundation of mathematical reasoning that should be acquired before attempting such a course.

### Curriculum Overview and Goals

Software development and design is a core component of writing apps and software that users interact with every day. This curriculum seeks to develop software engineering skills and expose students interested in pursuing a computer science education to industry best practices while learning the Java programming language.

| Unit                                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Unit 1: Object-Oriented Programming**        | Students learn fundamental Java concepts, discover their identity as software engineers, and use debugging strategies and code reviews to improve their programming skills.                                              |
| **Unit 2: Class Structure and Design**         | Students develop an understanding of data encapsulation and object-oriented design decisions.                                                                                                                            |
| **Unit 3: Arrays and Algorithms**              | Students use one-dimensional (1D) arrays to store lists of primitive values and object references.                                                                                                                       |
| **Unit 4: Conditions and Logic**               | Students improve decision-making in their programs using relational and logical operators to evaluate primitive values and object references and use the Math class to perform calculations and generate random numbers. |
| **Unit 5: Two-Dimensional (2D) Arrays**        | Students use two-dimensional (2D) arrays to expand storage and organization capabilities in their programs.                                                                                                              |
| **Unit 6: ArrayLists and String Methods**      | Students use ArrayLists to store program data and work with methods in the String class to manipulate and evaluate String objects.                                                                                       |
| **Unit 7: Method Decomposition and Recursion** | Students practice software design and development using the skills and programming constructs they have learned and explore recursion.                                                                                   |
| **Unit 8: Searching and Sorting**              | Students implement searching and sorting algorithms to improve the efficiency and capabilities of their programs.                                                                                                        |
| **Unit 9: AP Exam Review and Practice**        | Students prepare for the AP CSA Exam by practicing strategies for the multiple-choice and free response questions.                                                                                                       |
