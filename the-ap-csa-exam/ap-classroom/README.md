# AP Classroom

Our objects-first layered approach to CSA means that many topics are divided across multiple units. Assigning an entire topic to a particular unit would contain questions on concepts that students have not yet learned.

To assign questions from the AP Classroom Question Bank that align with a particular unit or lesson, we recommend searching the Question Bank for the specific Essential Knowledge statements and creating a custom quiz with these questions. You can find instructions and video demonstrations at [**apcentral.collegeboard.org/instructional-resources/ap-classroom**](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/instructional-resources/ap-classroom).

In the following outline, we have indicated which Essential Knowledge statements are addressed and suggested Topic Questions and Progress Checks for applicable lessons and units.
