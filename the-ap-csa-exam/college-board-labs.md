# College Board Labs

The College Board provides several programming labs for students to apply the skills learned throughout the course to new problems and scenarios. While not required, these can be useful for providing students opportunities to practice Java programming and problem-solving skills in addition to the end-of-unit projects in the Code.org AP CSA curriculum. You may also choose to assign one or more programming labs as post-AP Exam activities so students can continue practicing the skills they learned in the course.

### College Board Programming Labs

The College Board programming labs outlined below are available for use in Java Lab as standalone units on Code Studio. Some of the College Board programming labs require the use of additional components of the Java API, such as graphical user interfaces, or the use of external APIs to retrieve data. Since Java Lab does not currently support these additional libraries, these College Board programming labs are not available for use in Java Lab. You can read more about the supported packages available in Java Lab [**here**](https://support.code.org/hc/en-us/articles/6351908324749-Java-Packages).

#### Magpie Lab

The Magpie Lab explores the basics of natural language processing as students create a chatbot program. Students work with a variety of methods of the String class and practice using if statements to evaluate user input to determine an appropriate response.

#### Consumer Review Lab

The Consumer Review lab explores how reviews for products and services are evaluated and sometimes manipulated. Students work with methods in the String class and practice using conditionals and iteration to design and implement algorithms to process text files containing reviews.

#### Data Lab

The Data Lab explores data retrieval and analysis techniques. Students practice developing questions, identifying appropriate data sources, and then writing code to read and process data to answer their questions.

### Accessing the College Board Programming Labs

#### Creating a Section

To use the College Board programming labs that are available for use in Java Lab, you will need to create a new section on Code Studio and assign the standalone unit to your students.

When you click the **Create a section** button on Code Studio, you can choose the College Board programming lab you want to assign from the **Course** dropdown menu. These programming labs can be found under the Other heading at the bottom of the course list. Each programming lab is a separate unit and will require a new section for each lab that you want to use.

#### Adding Students to the Section

There are two options for adding students to the new section you create for the programming lab.

**Option #1: Add students using the same steps you used to add students to your CSA section.**

This option will leave students in your existing CSA section and add them to an additional section to access the programming lab. This allows students to access both the CSA curriculum and the College Board programming lab you want to assign at the same time.

**Option #2: Move students from your existing CSA section to the programming lab section.**

You can move students from your existing CSA section to the new section you create for the College Board programming lab.

1.  From the **Manage Students** tab of your existing CSA section on your Teacher Dashboard, click the **Move students** button.\

2.  Choose the students you want to move to the new section (or select the top checkbox to select all students), then choose the new section for the College Board programming lab from the dropdown. Click the **Move students** button to confirm the move.

When you are finished with the programming lab, you can move students back to your existing CSA section using the same students. Any progress made in the CSA curriculum and the College Board programming lab will _**not**_ be lost when moving students.
